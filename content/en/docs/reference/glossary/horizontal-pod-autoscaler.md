HPA is typically used with {{< glossary_tooltip text="Replication Controllers" term_id="replication-controller" >}}, {{< glossary_tooltip text="Deployments" term_id="deployment" >}}, or Replica Sets. It cannot be applied to objects that cannot be scaled, for example {{< glossary_tooltip text="DaemonSets" term_id="daemonset" >}}.
