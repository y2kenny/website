A platform developer may, for example, use [Custom Resources](/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/) or [Extend the Kubernetes API with the aggregation layer](/docs/concepts/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/) to add functionality to their instance of Kubernetes, specifically for their application.  Some Platform Developers are also {{< glossary_tooltip text="contributors" term_id="contributor" >}} and develop extensions which are contributed to the Kubernetes community.  Others develop closed-source commercial or site-specific extensions.
