  ReplicaSet is the next-generation Replication Controller.

ReplicaSet, like ReplicationController, ensures that a specified number of pods replicas are running at one time. ReplicaSet supports the new set-based selector requirements as described in the labels user guide, whereas a Replication Controller only supports equality-based selector requirements.
