A Volume Plugin lets you attach and mount storage volumes for use by a {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pod" term_id="pod" >}}. Volume plugins can be _in tree_ or _out of tree_. _In tree_ plugins are part of the Kubernetes code repository and follow its release cycle. _Out of tree_ plugins are developed independently.
